# Golang RSS Feed Parser

This demo project written in Go uses [GoFeed](github.com/mmcdole/gofeed") to parse a list of RSS feeds designated by their URLs. The original purpose of this project is to have a list of cyber-security RSS feeds that can be retrived and parsed each day. When new updates are published, the output HTML file can quickly be reviewed for the days' feed.
